# Autoencoder-with-survival-analysis-methods
In this code, I have used the autoencoder neural network before survival analysis methods (eg. cox regression and random survival forest) to enhance the performance and increase the prediction accuracy.
I have applied this code on three different datasets in order to verify results.
The autoencoder implemented in my code is applied on GPU. The GPU is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.
