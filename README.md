# Autoencoder-with-survival-analysis-methods
In this code, I have used the autoencoder neural network before survival analysis methods (eg. cox regression and random survival forest) to enhance the performance and increase the prediction accuracy.
This code is applied on three different datasets in order to verify results.
The first dataset has 24368 features and 1904 samples, the second dataset has 5567 features and 522 samples and the third dataset has 140 features and 962 sample.
The autoencoder implemented in my code is run over GPU. The GPU is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.
