I have uploaded 10 randomly selected samples from each dataset of the three datasets which I have uploaded my code on. 
The first dataset has up to 24368 feature, so that it is transposed to fit in the excel sheet. 
The first dataset has 24368 features and 1904 samples, the second dataset has 5567 features and 522 samples and the third dataset has 140 features and 962 sample.
